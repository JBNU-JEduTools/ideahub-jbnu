## making/resolving issues

there are some issues with 'bug' and 'help wanted' tags.
you can start contributing by resolving those issues.
there must be more bugs. so, not just resolving them, you can also contribute by finding new bugs or issues!

## documentation

translation is needed! translating korean documents into english one is going to be huge help!

## style guidlines

for uniformed code style, i recommend you to follow those rules.

- use 'single quote' to wrap string
- tab width : 2 space

if you work using VS code, [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is a nice choice.

please make .prettierrc in frontend directory.

```
//YOUR_DIRECTORY\cmanager\frontend\.prettierrc
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "semi": true,
  "useTabs": false,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "printWidth": 80
}
```
